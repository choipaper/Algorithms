# 001.Reverse String

## Problem
Write a function that reverses a string.  
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
## Solution
- Asking for? in-place algorithm = transform input using no auxiliary data structure
```cpp
void reverseString(vector<char>& s)
{
    for (size_t i = 0; i <s.size()/2; i++)
    {
        char temp = s[i];
        s[i] = s[s.size() - 1 - i];
        s[s.size() - 1 - i] = temp;
    }
}
```
## Complexity Analysis
- Time complexity: It depends on the length of the given string, but it is impossible to perform if the length is an infinite number
- Space comlexity: O(1)
