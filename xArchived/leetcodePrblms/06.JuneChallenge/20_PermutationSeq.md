# 20.Permutaion Sequence

## Problem
The set [1,2,3,...,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:  
"123","132","213","231","312","321"  
Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

Note:

- Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
- Given k will be between 1 and n! inclusive.
```
Example 1:

Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: "213"
Example 2:

Input: n = 4, k = 9
Output: "2314"
```
## Solution
```cpp
string getPermutaition(int n, int k)
{

}
```
