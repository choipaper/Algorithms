# 22.Single Number II

## Problem
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

```
Example 1:
Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```
## Solution
```cpp
int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) 
{
    std::unordered_map<int,int> map;
    int single = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i ++)
    {
        map[nums[i]] = map[nums[i]] + 1;
    }
    for(const auto& it: map)
    {
        if(it.second == 1)
        {
            single = it.first;
        }
    }
    
    return single;
}
```
