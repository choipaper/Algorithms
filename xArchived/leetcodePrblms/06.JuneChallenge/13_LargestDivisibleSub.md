# 13.Largest Divisible Subset

## Problem
Given a set of distinct positive integers, find the largest subset such that every pair (Si, Sj) of elements in this subset satisfies:

Si % Sj = 0 or Sj % Si = 0.

If there are multiple solutions, return any subset is fine.  
- Examples
```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2] (of course, [1,3] will also be ok)

Input: [1,2,4,8]
Output: [1,2,4,8]
```
## Solution
```cpp
vector<int> largestDivisibleSubset(vector<int>& nums) 
{
    
}
```
