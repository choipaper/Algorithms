# 19.Longest Duplicate Substring

## Problem
Given a string S, consider all duplicated substrings: (contiguous) substrings of S that occur 2 or more times.  (The occurrences may overlap.)

Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible length.  (If S does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is "".)
```
Example 1:

Input: "banana"
Output: "ana"
Example 2:

Input: "abcd"
Output: ""
```
Note:  
1. 2 <= S.length <= 10^5
2. S consists of lowercase English letters.
## Solution
```cpp
string longestDupSubString(string S)
{
    
}
```
