# 05.Add and Search Word - Data structure design

## Problem
Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

void addWord(word)
bool search(word)
search(word) can search a literal word or a regular expression string containing only letters a-z or .. A . means it can represent any one letter.
```
Example:

addWord("bad")
addWord("dad")
addWord("mad")
search("pad") -> false
search("bad") -> true
search(".ad") -> true
search("b..") -> true
```
Note:
You may assume that all words are consist of lowercase letters a-z.

## Solution
- Thoughts
    - It can be made with either array or hash

```cpp
/**
 * Your WordDictionary object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * WordDictionary* obj = new WordDictionary();
 * obj->addWord(word);
 * bool param_2 = obj->search(word);
 */
class WordDictionary 
{
public:
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    WordDictionary() 
    {
        
    }
    
    /** Adds a word into the data structure. */
    void addWord(string word) 
    {
        
    }
    
    /** Returns if the word is in the data structure. A word could contain the dot character '.' to represent any one letter. */
    bool search(string word) 
    {
        
    }
};


```
