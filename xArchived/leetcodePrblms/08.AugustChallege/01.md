# 01.Detect Capital

## Problem
Given a word, you need to judge whether the usage of capitals in it is right or not.

We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:

- All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
- All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
- Only the first letter in this word is capital, like "Google".  
Otherwise, we define that this word doesn't use capitals in a right way.
 
```
Example 1:

Input: "USA"
Output: True
 

Example 2:

Input: "FlaG"
Output: False
```
Note: The input will be a non-empty word consisting of uppercase and lowercase latin letters.
## Solution
```cpp
bool detectCapitalUse(string word)
{

}
```
