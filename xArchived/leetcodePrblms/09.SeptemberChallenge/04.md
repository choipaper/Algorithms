# 04.Partition Labels

## Problem
A string S of lowercase English letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.
```
Example 1:

Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.
```
Note:

- S will have length in range [1, 500].
- S will consist of lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z') only.
## Solution
```cpp
vector<int> partitionLabels(string S)
{
    
}
```
