# 07.Word Pattern

## Problem
Given a pattern and a string str, find if str follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in str.
```
Example 1:

Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input:pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish"
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog"
Output: false
Example 4:

Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog"
Output: false
```
Notes:
You may assume pattern contains only lowercase letters, and str contains lowercase letters that may be separated by a single space.

## Solution
```cpp
bool wordPattern(string pattern, string str)
{
    
}
```
