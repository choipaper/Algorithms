# 03.Repeated Substring Pattern

## Problem
Given a non-empty string check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together. You may assume the given string consists of lowercase English letters only and its length will not exceed 10000.
```
Example 1:

Input: "abab"
Output: True
Explanation: It's the substring "ab" twice.
Example 2:

Input: "aba"
Output: False
Example 3:

Input: "abcabcabcabc"
Output: True
Explanation: It's the substring "abc" four times. (And the substring "abcabc" twice.)
```
## Solution

bool repeatedSubstringPattern(string s)
{

}
```
