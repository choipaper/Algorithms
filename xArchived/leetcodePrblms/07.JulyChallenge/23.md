# 23.Single Number III

## Problem
Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.
```
Example:

Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
```
Note:
1. The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
2. Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?
## Solution
- Idea:  
    - we have numbers either appear twice or once
    - set map with elements(numbers)
    - if duplicate, increase numbers in the index
    - ex) map[1] = 2, map[2] = 2, map[3] = 1
    - find the number with only one element and return it
```cpp
vector<int> singleNumber(vector<int>& nums)
{
    // Create map 
    unordered_map<int,int> numMap;
    
    // Create result vector
    vector<int> res;
    
    for(auto& i : nums)
    {
        numMap.insert({i, numMap[i]++});
    }
    
    for(auto& e: numMap)
    {
        if(e.second == 1)
        {
            res.push_back(e.first);
        }
    }
    
    return res;
}
```
