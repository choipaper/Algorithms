# 24.All Paths from Source to Targert

## Problem
Given a directed, acyclic graph of N nodes.  Find all possible paths from node 0 to node N-1, and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows:  the nodes are 0, 1, ..., graph.length - 1.  graph[i] is a list of all nodes j for which the edge (i, j) exists.
```
Example:
Input: [[1,2], [3], [3], []] 
Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]] 
Explanation: The graph looks like this:
0--->1
|    |
v    v
2--->3
There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.
```
Note:

- The number of nodes in the graph will be in the range [2, 15].
- You can print different paths in any order, but you should keep the order of nodes inside one path.
## Solution
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> allPathsSourceTarget(vector<vector<int>>& graph)
{

}
```
