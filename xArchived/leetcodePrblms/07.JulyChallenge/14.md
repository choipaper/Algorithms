# 14.Angle Between Hands of a Clock

## Problem
Given two numbers, hour and minutes. Return the smaller angle (in degrees) formed between the hour and the minute hand.

 
```
Example 1:
Input: hour = 12, minutes = 30
Output: 165

Example 2:
Input: hour = 3, minutes = 30
Output: 75

Example 3:
Input: hour = 3, minutes = 15
Output: 7.5

Example 4:
Input: hour = 4, minutes = 50
Output: 155

Example 5:
Input: hour = 12, minutes = 0
Output: 0
 
```
Constraints:
- 1 <= hour <= 12
- 0 <= minutes <= 59
- Answers within 10^-5 of the actual value will be accepted as correct.
## Solution
We know that:  
- 1 min = 6 degree
- 1 h = 30 degree
- hour hand moves 1 space(1 min in clock)every 12 mins

- How I tought
1. convert hour to min  
    1-1. when converting, add extra space based on minutes    
         use `(current minutes / 12) + convertedHour`
2. calculate differences between two numbers  
    2-1. `(minutes - convertedHour)*6`
3. return smaller angle
```cpp
// 0ms / 5.9MB
double angleClock(int hour, int minutes)
{
    // convert hour by using (h%12)*5 or create as function
    double convertedHr = (hour % 12) * 5;
    
    // calculate extra space that hour hand moved based on minute
    convertedHr += (minutes / 12);

    // calculate total degree
    double angle = std::abs((convertedHr - minutes) * 6);
    
    // if angle is smaller than other angle
    if(angle < (360 - angle))
    {
        return angle;
    }
    
    // otherwise 
    return 360 - angle;
    
}
```
