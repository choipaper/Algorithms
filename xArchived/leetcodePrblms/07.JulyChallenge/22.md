# 22.Binary Tree Zigzag Level order traversal

## Problem
Given a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).
```
For example:
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

return its zigzag level order traversal as:
[
  [3],
  [20,9],
  [15,7]
]
```
## Solution
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> zigzagLevelOrder(TreeNode* root)
{
    
}
```
