# 07.Coin Change 2

## Problem
You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money.  
Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount.  
You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.  
- example
```
Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1

Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.

Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
Output: 1
```
## Solution
```cpp
int change(int amount, vector<int>& coins) 
{
    
}
```
