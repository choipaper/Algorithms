# 02.Contains Duplicate III

## Problem
Given an array of integers, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] is at most t and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3, t = 0
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1, t = 2
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,5,9,1,5,9], k = 2, t = 3
Output: false
```
## Solution
```cpp
bool containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(vector<int>& nums, int k, int t) 
{
        
}
```
