# 11.Maximum Product Subarray

## Problem
Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.
```
Example 1:

Input: [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
Example 2:

Input: [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
```
## Solution
```cpp
int maxProduct(vector<int>& nums)
{
    
}
```
