# 15.Reverse Words in a String

## Problem
Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.
```
Example 1:
Input: "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"

Example 2:
Input: "  hello world!  "
Output: "world! hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.

Example 3:
Input: "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

Note:

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

For C programmers, try to solve it in-place in O(1) extra space.
## Solution
```cpp
string reverseWords(string s)
{
    string delimiter = " ";
    string token;
    size_t pos = 0;
    std::stack<string> reverse;
    //if string is ""
    if(s == "")
    {
        return s;
    }
    // delete " " and get only words into stack
    while ((pos = s.find(delimiter)) != std::string::npos) 
    {
        token = s.substr(0, pos);
        if(token != "")
        {
            reverse.push(token);
        }
        s.erase(0, pos + delimiter.length());
    }
    // if string is not empty and stack is not empty
    // because above while loop will stop delete elements of string when they reach the end
    if(!s.empty() && !reverse.empty())
    {
        s += " ";
    }

    // if stack is empty
    if(reverse.empty())
    {
        // if string isn't empty then it means only one word with " "(possibly more then 1  of " ")
        if(!s.empty())
        {
            return s;
        }
        s = "";
    }
    // otherwise 
    else
    {
        // since stack is LIFO
        while(!reverse.empty())
        {   
            // if it is last element
            // do not add space 
            if(reverse.size() == 1)
            {
                s += reverse.top();
            }
            else
            {
                s += reverse.top() + delimiter;    
            }
            reverse.pop();
        } 
    }
        
    return s;
}
