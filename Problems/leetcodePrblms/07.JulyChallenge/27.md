# 27.Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal

## Problem
Given inorder and postorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.

Note:  
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.
```
Example:
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
postorder = [9,15,7,20,3]
Return the following binary tree:

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```
## Solution
```cpp
TreeNode* buildTree(vector<int>& inorder, vector<int>& postorder)
{

}
```
