# 11.Subsets

## Problem
Given a set of distinct integers, nums, return all possible subsets (the power set).

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.
```
Example:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output:
[
  [3],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  []
]
```
## Solution
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> subsets(vector<int>& nums)
{
    
}
```
