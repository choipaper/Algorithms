# 19.Add Binary

## Problem
Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).

The input strings are both non-empty and contains only characters 1 or 0.
```
Example 1:
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"

Example 2:
Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
```
Constraints:
- Each string consists only of '0' or '1' characters.
- 1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^4
- Each string is either "0" or doesn't contain any leading zero.
## Solution
1. add from last element of strings untill add every elements  
    1-1. if addition = 2, add 0 to the result string then set addition = 1  
    1-2. else add to the result string
2. reverse result string then return
```cpp
string addBinary(string a, string b)
{
    if(a == "0")
    {
        return b;
    }
    if(b == "0")
    {
        return a;
    }
    
    int i = a.length() - 1;
    int j = b.length() - 1;
    int sum = 0;

}
```
