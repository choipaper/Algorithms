# 1487.Making File Names Unique

## Problem
Given an array of strings names of size n. You will create n folders in your file system such that, at the ith minute, you will create a folder with the name names[i].

Since two files cannot have the same name, if you enter a folder name which is previously used, the system will have a suffix addition to its name in the form of (k), where, k is the smallest positive integer such that the obtained name remains unique.

Return an array of strings of length n where ans[i] is the actual name the system will assign to the ith folder when you create it.
```
Example 1:

Input: names = ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)"]
Output: ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)"]
Explanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
"pes" --> not assigned before, remains "pes"
"fifa" --> not assigned before, remains "fifa"
"gta" --> not assigned before, remains "gta"
"pes(2019)" --> not assigned before, remains "pes(2019)"
Example 2:

Input: names = ["gta","gta(1)","gta","avalon"]
Output: ["gta","gta(1)","gta(2)","avalon"]
Explanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
"gta" --> not assigned before, remains "gta"
"gta(1)" --> not assigned before, remains "gta(1)"
"gta" --> the name is reserved, system adds (k), since "gta(1)" is also reserved, systems put k = 2. it becomes "gta(2)"
"avalon" --> not assigned before, remains "avalon"
Example 3:

Input: names = ["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece"]
Output: ["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece(4)"]
Explanation: When the last folder is created, the smallest positive valid k is 4, and it becomes "onepiece(4)".
Example 4:

Input: names = ["wano","wano","wano","wano"]
Output: ["wano","wano(1)","wano(2)","wano(3)"]
Explanation: Just increase the value of k each time you create folder "wano".
Example 5:

Input: names = ["kaido","kaido(1)","kaido","kaido(1)"]
Output: ["kaido","kaido(1)","kaido(2)","kaido(1)(1)"]
Explanation: Please note that system adds the suffix (k) to current name even it contained the same suffix before.
 
```
Constraints:
- 1 <= names.length <= 5 * 10^4
- 1 <= names[i].length <= 20
- names[i] consists of lower case English letters, digits and/or round brackets.
## Solution
```cpp
// try
vector<string> getFolderNames(vector<string>& names) 
{
    vector<string> output;
    
    for(int i = 0; i < names.size(); i++ )
    {
        int j = 0;
        int count = 0;
        while(j < output.size())
        {
            string out = output[j];
            if(names[i] == out)
            {
                count++;
            }
            // if string has () suffix
            if(out[out.length() - 1] == ')')
            {
                //std::cout << ") found!";
                if(out[out.length()- 3 ] == '(')
                {
                    //std::cout << "(found";
                    //cout << out.substr(0, out.length() - 3);
                    // check if suffix(0) case
                    if(out[out.length()-4] != 0)
                    {
                        // check suffix has same name with input
                        if(names[i] == out.substr(0, out.length() - 3))
                        {
                            count++;
                        //std::cout << "found and increase count" << count;
                        }    
                    }
                    
                }
            }
            j++;
        }
        if(count != 0)
        {
            string input = names[i] + '('+ to_string(count) + ')';
            output.push_back(input);    
        }
        else
        {
            output.push_back(names[i]);
        }
        
    }
    
    return output;
}   
```
