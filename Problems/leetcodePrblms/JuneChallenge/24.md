# 24.Unique Binary Search Trees

## Problem
Given n, how many structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1 ... n?
```
Example:

Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
Given n = 3, there are a total of 5 unique BST's:

   1         3     3      2      1
    \       /     /      / \      \
     3     2     1      1   3      2
    /     /       \                 \
   2     1         2                 3
```
## Solution
```cpp
int numTrees(int n)
{
    if(n == 0 || n == 1)
    {
        return 1;
    }
    int count = 0;
    
}
```
